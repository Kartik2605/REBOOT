# REBOOT
Its a game developed by game development team of Envisage10.0  IIT Madras. 

It is a 3D third player control spaceshooting and a mission game. The primary moto of the project of making game is to give user an imersive experience of gameplay. In these the head movements control the 6 degrees of motion of the spaceship and shooting is control by hand gestures.
