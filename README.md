# REBOOT
Its a game developed by game development team of Envisage10.0  IIT Madras. 

It is a 3D third player control spaceshooting and a mission game. The primary moto of the project of making game is to give user an imersive experience of gameplay. In these the head movements control the 6 degrees of motion of the spaceship and shooting is control by hand gestures.  
Currently we have released a windows buid for normal keyboard controls. The work on head tracking and hand gesture recgnition is going on. We found some problems while testing our code. Its open source so you can checkout and contribute too here!
